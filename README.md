# StudentCareerGuidanceSystem

This is a system which I developed for the Master's Degree Project, which provides a suitable higher educational and career suggestions for a student, by analyzing his/her examination/extra curricular activities.

It is based on the Howard Gardner's 'Multiple Intellignces Theory' to provide a suitable output.

The system was developed using MVC architecture. (PHP + SQL + HTNL + CSS)
